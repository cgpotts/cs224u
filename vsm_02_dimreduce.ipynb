    "\n",
    "The matrix weighting schemes reviewed in the first notebook for this unit deliver solid results. However, they are not capable of capturing higher-order associations in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "With dimensionality reduction, the goal is to eliminate correlations in the input VSM and capture such higher-order notions of co-occurrence, thereby improving the overall space.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a motivating example, consider the adjectives _gnarly_ and _wicked_ used as slang positive adjectives.  Since both are positive, we expect them to be similar in a good VSM. However, at least stereotypically, _gnarly_ is Californian and _wicked_ is Bostonian. Thus, they are unlikely to occur often in the same texts, and so the methods we've reviewed so far will not be able to model their similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction techniques are often capable of capturing such semantic similarities (and have the added advantage of shrinking the size of our data structures)."

    "\n",
    "$$X_{m \\times n} = T_{m \\times m}S_{m\\times m}D_{n \\times m}^{\\top}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrices $T$ and $D$ are  __orthonormal__ – their columns are length-normalized and orthogonal to one another (that is, they each have cosine distance of $1$ from each other). The singular-value matrix $S$ is a diagonal matrix arranged by size, so that the first dimension corresponds to the greatest source of variability in the data, followed by the second, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we don't want to factorize and rebuild the original matrix, as that wouldn't get us anywhere. The __truncation__ part means that we include only the top $k$ dimensions of $S$. Given our row-oriented perspective on these matrices, this means using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T[1{:}m, 1{:}k]S[1{:}k, 1{:}k]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "To build up intuitions, imagine that everyone on the Stanford campus is associated with a 3d point representing their position: $x$ is east–west, $y$ is north–south, and $z$ is zenith–nadir. Since the campus is spread out and has relatively few deep basements and tall buildings, the top two dimensions of variation will be $x$ and $y$, and the 2d truncated SVD of this space will leave $z$ out. This will, for example, capture the sense in which someone at the top of Hoover Tower is close to someone at its base."

    "* Contextualized word representations have proven valuable in many contexts. These methods do not provide representations for individual words, but rather represent them in their linguistic context. This creates space for modeling how word senses vary depending on their context of use. We will study these methods later in the quarter, mainly in the context of identifying ways that might achieve better results on your projects."
