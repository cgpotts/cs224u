    "The matrix weighting schemes reviewed in the first notebook for this unit deliver solid results. However, they are not capable of capturing higher-order associations in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "With dimensionality reduction, the goal is to eliminate correlations in the input VSM and capture such higher-order notions of co-occurrence, thereby improving the overall space.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a motivating example, consider the adjectives _gnarly_ and _wicked_ used as slang positive adjectives.  Since both are positive, we expect them to be similar in a good VSM. However, at least stereotypically, _gnarly_ is Californian and _wicked_ is Bostonian. Thus, they are unlikely to occur often in the same texts, and so the methods we've reviewed so far will not be able to model their similarity. \n",

    "Dimensionality reduction techniques are often capable of capturing such semantic similarities (and have the added advantage of shrinking the size of our data structures)."

    "\n",
    "$$X_{m \\times n} = T_{m \\times m}S_{m\\times m}D_{n \\times m}^{\\top}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrices $T$ and $D$ are  __orthonormal__ – their columns are length-normalized and orthogonal to one another (that is, they each have cosine distance of $1$ from each other). The singular-value matrix $S$ is a diagonal matrix arranged by size, so that the first dimension corresponds to the greatest source of variability in the data, followed by the second, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we don't want to factorize and rebuild the original matrix, as that wouldn't get us anywhere. The __truncation__ part means that we include only the top $k$ dimensions of $S$. Given our row-oriented perspective on these matrices, this means using\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T[1{:}m, 1{:}k]S[1{:}k, 1{:}k]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "To build up intuitions, imagine that everyone on the Stanford campus is associated with a 3d point representing their position: $x$ is east–west, $y$ is north–south, and $z$ is zenith–nadir. Since the campus is spread out and has relatively few deep basements and tall buildings, the top two dimensions of variation will be $x$ and $y$, and the 2d truncated SVD of this space will leave $z$ out. This will, for example, capture the sense in which someone at the top of Hoover Tower is close to someone at its base."

See also [Cotterell et al. 2017](https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/E17-2028/e17-2028) for an interpretation of this model as a variant of PCA."

I assume that this same process could be modeled by sampling (row, column) index pairs from our count matrices proportional to their cell values. However, I couldn't get this to work well. I'd be grateful if someone got it work or figured out why it won't!\n",

Because TensorFlow has a built in loss function called `tf.nn.nce_loss`, it is especially simple to define these models – one pretty much just sets up an embedding $X$, a context matrix $W$, and a bias $b$, and then feeds them plus a training batch to the loss function.\n",

(GloVe simply ignores 0 count cells and so can't do this.)\n",

    "* There is growing awareness that many apparently diverse models can be expressed as matrix factorization methods like SVD/LSA. See especially \n",
    "[Singh and Gordon 2008](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/singh-gordon-unified-factorization-ecml.pdf),\n",
    "[Levy and Golberg 2014](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5477-neural-word-embedding-as-implicit-matrix-factorization), [Cotterell et al. 2017](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E17-2028/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Subword modeling ([reviewed briefly in the previous notebook](vsm_01_distributional.ipynb#Subword-information)) is increasingly yielding dividends. (It would already be central if most of NLP focused on languages with complex morphology!) Check out the papers at the Subword and Character-Level Models for NLP Workshops: [SCLeM 2017](https://sites.google.com/view/sclem2017/home), [SCLeM 2018](https://sites.google.com/view/sclem2018/home).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contextualized word representations have proven valuable in many contexts. These methods do not provide representations for individual words, but rather represent them in their linguistic context. This creates space for modeling how word senses vary depending on their context of use. We will study these methods later in the quarter, mainly in the context of identifying ways that might achieve better results on your projects."
