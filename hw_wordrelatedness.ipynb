    "Word similarity and relatedness datasets have long been used to evaluate distributed representations. This notebook provides code for conducting such analyses with a new word relatedness datasets. It consists of word pairs, each with an associated human-annotated relatedness score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for each dataset is the [Spearman correlation coefficient $\\rho$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) between the annotated scores and your distances, as is standard in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework ([questions at the bottom of this notebook](#Homework-questions)) asks you to write code that uses the count matrices in `data/vsmdata` to create and evaluate some baseline models. The final question asks you to create your own original system for this task, using any data you wish. This accounts for 9 of the 10 points for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the associated bake-off, we will distribute a new dataset, and you will evaluate your original system (no additional training or tuning allowed!) on that datasets and submit your predictions. Systems that enter will receive the additional homework point, and systems that achieve the top score will receive an additional 0.5 points."

    "The notebook [vsm_04_contextualreps.ipynb](vsm_04_contextualreps.ipynb) explores methods for deriving static vector representations of words from the contextual representations given by models like BERT and RoBERTa. The methods are due to [Bommasani et al. 2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.431). The simplest of these methods involves processing the words as independent texts and pooling the sub-word representations that result, using a function like mean or max.\n",
