    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework and associated bake-off are devoted to the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST). The homework questions ask you to implement some baseline systems and some original feature functions, and the bake-off challenge is to define a system that does extremely well at the SST task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on the ternary task as defined by `sst.ternary_class_func` This isn't used in the literature but I think it is the best version of the SST problem for the reasons given [here](sst_01_overview.ipynb#Modeling-the-SST-labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SST test set will be used for the bake-off evaluation. This dataset is already publicly distributed, so we are counting on people not to cheat by develping their models on the test set. You must do all your development without using the test set at all, and then evaluate exactly once on the test set and turn in the results, with no further system tuning or additional runs. __Much of the scientific integrity of our field depends on people adhering to this honor code__. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our only additional restriction is that you cannot use any of the subtree labels as input features. You can have your system learn to predict them (as intended), but no feature function can make use of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our goals for this homework and bake-off is to encourage you to engage in __the basic development cycle for supervised models__, in which you\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a new feature function. We recommend starting with something simple.\n",
    "1. Use `sst.experiment` to evaluate your new feature function, with at least `fit_softmax_classifier`.\n",
    "1. If you have time, compare your feature function with `unigrams_phi` using `sst.compare_models` or `utils.mcnemar`. (For discussion, see [this notebook section](sst_02_hand_built_features.ipynb#Statistical-comparison-of-classifier-models).)\n",
    "1. Return to step 1, or stop the cycle and conduct a more rigorous evaluation with hyperparameter tuning and assessment on the `dev` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Error analysis](#Error-analysis) is one of the most important methods for steadily improving a system, as it facilitates a kind of human-powered hill-climbing on your ultimate objective. Often, it takes a careful human analyst just a few examples to spot a major pattern that can lead to a beneficial change to the feature representations."

If you spend more than a few hours on this homework problem, you should consider letting it grow into your final project! Here are some relatively manageable ideas that you might try:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We didn't systematically evaluate the `bidirectional` option to the `TorchRNNClassifier`. Similarly, that model could be tweaked to allow multiple LSTM layers (at present there is only one), and you could try adding layers to the classifier portion of the model as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We've already glimpsed the power of rich initial word representations, and later in the course we'll see that smart initialization usually leads to a performance gain in NLP, so you could perhaps achieve a winning entry with a simple model that starts in a great place.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our [practical introduction to contextual word representations](contextualreps.ipynb) covers pretrained representations and interfaces that are likely to boost the performance of any system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `TreeNN` and `TorchTreeNN` don't perform all that well, and this could be for the same reason that RNNs don't peform well: the gradient signal doesn't propagate reliably down inside very deep trees. [Tai et al. 2015](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P15-1150/) sought to address this with TreeLSTMs, which are fairly easy to implement in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to emphasize that this needs to be an __original__ system. It doesn't suffice to download code from the Web, retrain, and submit. You can build on others' code, but you have to do something new and meaningful with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, please provide a brief technical description of your original system, so that the teaching team can gain an understanding of what it does. This will help us to understand your code and analyze all the submissions to identify patterns and strategies.
