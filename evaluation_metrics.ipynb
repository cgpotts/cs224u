    "1. If you're working on an established problem, then you'll feel pressure from readers (and referees) to use the metrics that have already been used for the problem. This might be a compelling pressure. However, you should always feel free to argue against those cultural norms and motivate new ones. Areas can stagnate due to poor metrics, so we must be vigilant!\n",

    "With precision–recall curves, we get a generalized perspective on F1 scores (and we could weight precision and recall differently to achieve the effects of `beta` for F scores more generally).

However, instead of balancing precision and recall, it balances recall against the false positive rate. Precision–recall curves are more appropriate than ROC curves in situations where the two classes are very different in size. Since this is common in NLP, precision–recall curves are more common.\n",
