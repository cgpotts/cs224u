    "\n",
    "This notebook defines and explores a number of models for NLI. The general plot is familiar from [our work with the Stanford Sentiment Treebank](sst_01_overview.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Models based on sparse feature representations\n",
    "1. Linear classifiers and feed-forward neural classifiers using dense feature representations\n",
    "1. Recurrent neural networks (and, briefly, tree-structured neural networks)\n",
    "\n",
    "The twist here is that, while NLI is another classification problem, the inputs have important high-level structure: __a premise__ and __a hypothesis__. This invites exploration of a host of neural designs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In __sentence-encoding__ models, the premise and hypothesis are analyzed separately, and combined only for the final classification step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In __chained__ models, the premise is processed first, then the hypotheses, giving a unified representation of the pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLI resembles sequence-to-sequence problems like __machine translation__ and __language modeling__. The central modeling difference is that NLI doesn't produce an output sequence, but rather consumes two sequences to produce a label. Still, there are enough affinities that many ideas have been shared among these areas."

This is by no means guaranteed, but it seems like a good way to balance doing serious hyperparameter search with the costs of doing dozens or even thousands of experiments.
