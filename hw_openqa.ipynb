    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to explore few-shot (or, prompt-based) learning in the context of open-domain question answering. This is an exciting area that brings together a number of recent task ideas and modeling innovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our core task is __open-domain question answering (OpenQA)__. In this task, all that is given by the dataset is a question text, and the task is to answer that question. By contrast, in modern QA tasks, the dataset provides a text and a gold passage, with a guarantee that the answer will be a substring of the passage. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenQA is substantially harder than standard QA. The usual strategy is to use a _retriever_ to find passages in a large collection of texts and train a _reader_ to find answers in those passages. This means we have no guarantee that the retrieved passage will contain the answer we need. If we don't retrieve a passage containing the answer, our reader has no hope of succeeding. Although this is challenging, it is much more realistic and widely applicable than standard QA. After all, with the right retriever, an OpenQA system could be deployed over the entire Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task posed by this homework is harder even than OpenQA. We are calling this task __few-shot OpenQA__. The defining feature of this task is that the reader is simply a general purpose autoregressive language model. It accepts string inputs (prompts) and produces text in response. It is not trained to answer questions per se, and nothing about its structure ensures that it will respond with a substring of the prompt corresponding to anything like an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Few-shot QA__ (but not OpenQA!) is explored in the famous GPT-3 paper ([Brown et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)). The authors are able to get traction on the problem using GPT-3, an incredible finding. Our task here – __few-shot OpenQA__ – pushes this even further by retrieving passages to use in the prompt rather than assuming that the gold passage can be used in the prompt. If we can make this work, then it should be a major step towards flexibly and easily deploying QA technologies in new domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task             | Passage given | Task-specific reader training |Task-specific retriever training  | \n",
    "|-----------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|\n",

    "\n",
    "Just to repeat: your mission (should you choose to accept it!) is to explore the final line in this table. The core notebook and assignment don't address the issue of training the retriever in a task-specific way, but we've given some pointers on this in the context of [the original system question at the bottom of this notebook](#Your-original-system-[3-points]).\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, this notebook sets up the task and provides starter code. We proceed through a series of approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Open QA with no context_: the prompt consists of the question, and we just see what comes back. This is not particularly fair to the system since it doesn't unambiguously convey what we want it to do, but it's a start.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Few-shot QA_: the prompt contains one or more examples formatted so as to indirectly convey what we want the system to do, and it uses the gold passage associated with the example. This is the approach of the GPT-3 paper. It works only for datasets with gold passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Open QA with ColBERT retrieval_: This is roughly as in the previous case, but now we presume no access to a gold passage for our example. Rather, we retrieve a passage from a large corpus using the neural information retrieval model ColBERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples are followed by some assignment questions aimed at helping you to think creatively about the problem. These problems improve on the above approaches in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this culminates in an original system question and some code and unlabeled data (here, just a list of questions) for the bake-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a requirement of the bake-off that a pure autoregressive model be used. In particular, trained QA systems cannot be used at all. See the original system question at the bottom of this message for the full list of allowed models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the models we are working with here are _big_. This poses a challenge that is increasingly common in NLP: you have to pay one way or another. You can pay to use the GPT-3 API, or you can pay to use an Eleuther model on a heavy-duty cluster computer, or you can pay with time by using an Eleuther model on a more modest computer. If none of these options is palatable, you might consider instead doing the [color reference assignment](hw_colors.ipynb)!"

    "* [EleutherAI](https://www.eleuther.ai/) has released GPT-2-style models in a variety of sizes. These are free to use and easy to use via Hugging Face, and the larger ones very effective for our task, with GPT-J competitive with GPT-3 even though it has only 6B parameters (vs. 145B for GPT-3). The downside here is that the larger models in this family might be very slow and very difficult to work with unless you have access to really impressive GPU hardware. In testing with the free version of Google Colab, we were basically able to do everything we needed to do for the 1.3B parameter model, but the larger one caused too many problems to be viable.\n",

    "* OpenAI has outstanding API access to GPT-3. You can sign up for [a free account](https://beta.openai.com/signup), and, as of this writing, you get US$18 in credit when you sign up. This is more than enough for the current assignment provided you are careful about how much testing you do. The benefits here are that the API is blazingly fast and requires nothing of your computer in terms of GPU support, and you're getting responses from a 145B parameter model that is truly exceptional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our suggestion is to do basic development with `\"gpt-neo-125M\"`, scale up to `\"gpt-neo-1.3B\"` once you have a sense for what your original system will be like, and then do your final bake-off entry with GPT-3. The functions `run_eleuther` and `run_gpt3` defined below are totally interchangeable, so this kind of development path should be easy to take."

    "### Your original system [3 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "This question asks you to design your own few-shot OpenQA system. All of the code above can be used and modified for this, and the requirement is just that you try something new that goes beyond what we've done so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "Terms for the bake-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can make free use of SQuAD and other publicly available data.\n",
    "* The LM must be an autoregressive language model. No trained QA components can be used. Our list of preallowed models are those available via the OpenAI API whose names begin with \"text\" and the Eluether models \"gpt-neo-125M\", \"gpt-neo-1.3B\", \"gpt-neo-2.7B\", and \"gpt-j-6B\". If you would like to use a model outside of this set, please check with the teaching team first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas for the original system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have so far sampled randomly from the SQuaD train set to create few-shot prompts. One might instead sample passages that have some connection to the target question.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have used actual SQuAD training examples to build contexts. These might be different in meaningful ways from the passages in our corpus. An alternative is to use the SQuAD question–answer pairs to retrieve passages that contain the answer and use the resulting question–answer–passage triple when building prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are a lot of parameters to our LMs that we have so far ignored. Exploring different values might lead to better results. The `temperature` parameter is highly impactful for our task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have distributed a fixed index of 100K passages. These cover SQuAD plus our bake-off data, but there might still be value in creating a different/expanded index. There is starter code for indexing data with ColBERT [here](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT/blob/new_api/docs/intro.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Khattab et al. (2021a)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.tacl-1.55/) fine-tune the retriever through a handful of successive rounds, using weak supervision from the QA dataset. This is an ambitious direction that could quickly build to an original project, as the role of retriever training is under-explored so far in the context of few-shot OpenQA.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In our \"Answer scoring\" question, we don't normalize scores by answer length. Such normalization might be fairer to long answers and so seems worth adding.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our \"Answer scoring\" question is inspired by the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model of [Lewis et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401). Their model fully marginalizes over $k$ retrieved passages to create a proper model of $P(\\textrm{answer} \\mid \\textrm{question})$. Implementing this requires having the probabilities for the prompts. For GPT-3, these can be obtained with `echo=False`, which will lead you to have to make changes to the output processing of `run_gpt3`. For the Eleuther models, one needs to do another call to the model forward function. Here is some starter code that could be used to begin modifying `run_eleuther`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "    prompt_logits = eleuther_model(prompt_ids).logits                \n",
    "    prompt_probs = prompt_logits.softmax(-1)                                   \n",
    "    prompt_probs = torch.gather(prompt_probs, 2, prompt_ids[:, :, None]).squeeze(-1)\n",
