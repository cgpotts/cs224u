    "\n",
    "* The above models' feature representations have only 300 dimensions. While they are struggling with the neutral category, we can probably overcome this with some additional attention to the representations and to our strategies for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The promise of the Mittens model of [Dingwall and Potts 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09901) is that we can use GloVe itself to update the general purpose information in the 'glove.6B' vectors with specialized information from one of these IMDB count matrices. That might be worth trying; the `mittens` package (`pip install mittens`) already implements this!\n",
    "\n",
    "* That said, just averaging all the word representations is pretty unappealing linguistically. There's no doubt that we're losing a lot of valuable information in doing this. The models we turn to now can be seen as addressing this shortcoming while retaining the insight that our distributed representations are valuable for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We'll return to these ideas below, when we consider [the VecAvg baseline from Socher et al. 2013](#The-VecAvg-baseline-from-Socher-et-al.-2013). That model also posits a simple, fixed combination function (averaging). However, it begins with randomly initialized representations and updates them as part of training."

    "h_{t} &= \\tanh(x_{t}W_{xh} + h_{t-1}W_{hh}) \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",

The first line defines the recurrence: each hidden state $h_{t}$ is defined by the input $x_{t}$ and the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$, together with weight matrices $W_{xh}$ and $W_{hh}$, which are used at all timesteps. As indicated in the above diagram, the sequence of hidden states is padded with an initial state $h_{0}$. In our implementations, this is always an all $0$ vector, but it can be initialized in more sophisticated ways (some of which we will explore in our units on natural language inference and grounded natural language generation).\n",

This will depend on the choice one makes for `rnn_cell_class`; options include `nn.RNN`, `nn.LSTM`, and `nn.GRU`. In addition, the classifier part includes a hidden layer (middle row), and the user can decide on the activation funtion $f$ to use there (parameter: `classifier_activation`).\n",

    "This is a potential gain over our average-vectors baseline, in that it processes each word independently, and in the context of those that came before it. Thus, not only is this sensitive to word order, but the hidden representation create the potential to encode how the preceding context for a word affects its interpretation.\n",
